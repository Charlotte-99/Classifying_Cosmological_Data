# Classifying Cosmological Data through Machine Learning
Year 3 Physics Project

*By Hannah-Jo Wood and Charlotte Payne*

*Supervised by Professor Adam Moss*

This GitHub repository includes code to accompany our project e-diary and report. We were investigating the ability of a CNN to detect the presence of cosmic strings in images of CMB radiation.

The contents of the files are structured as follows:

**Data** - Files used during running of the code, including the Planck colour map and Planck power spectrum

**CNN_Experimentation** - Code relating to our investigations using TensorFlow from early on in the project, including regularisation techniques and practice at setting up models

**Final_Programs** - Final versions of code used in producing the results for the report

**Miscellaneous** - Some of our other code developed during the project, relevant to content of the e-diary. This includes investigations to classify CMB images according to their value of Omega_b and the pyshtools method for generating CMB maps
